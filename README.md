# Getting Started with Your React Application

If you don't have npm or Node.js installed, follow these steps to get started with your React application:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

2. Open the integrated terminal in VSCode.

3. Run the following command to create a new Vite project:

<code>$ npm create vite@latest</code>


4. Enter `.` to add it to the current directory.

5. Select the React framework when prompted.

6. Choose the variant 'Javascript + SWC' for improved performance. However, if SWC doesn't work for your project, you can use regular JavaScript.

7. Run the following command to install project dependencies:

<code>$ npm i</code>


## Understanding Dependencies

In the context of a React application, dependencies are external packages or libraries that you include in your project to add specific functionality or features.

## Running the Application

To start your application, use the following command:

<code>$ npm run dev</code>

This command will start your React application and make it accessible in your browser.

After following the above steps, copy the 'src' files provided and replace the 'src' section in your existing project files.
